          <h3>Trying New Things is Great!</h3>
          <!-- P1 -->
          <p> I also love to lean new things- I am a fast learner and have a great hunger for more knowledge. I have recently completed a cohort with Commonwealth Coders, an intensive 16-week program for web development. The focus was on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React and Python. In May 2022, I earned a certificate of completion and am seeking a position where I can continue to grow my web development skills and express my creativity.

          <article>Along with this exciting career change, I am moving across my beautiful Bluegrass State from the western region of Kentucky known as the Jackson Purchase to the Cumberland Lake region. I am most interested in remote work but am willing to join a local company.

        <p id="more-text">More than a web developer- I have worn many hats: wildlife biology student, chemistry minor, wife and mother, Homeschool Mom/Instructor as well as: scouts-swim-soccer-drama-choir Mom and now, Mimi. I love to do anything that involves a body of water in addition to camping, hiking and I enjoy the Arts in all forms. These have helped to make me uniquely skilled.</p>
